Even if you are not trying to identify a particular insect or spider it's fun to just pick this up and read off and on. Of course it cannot include ALL insects and spiders but the \"main\" ones are here. Highly recommended!",

The book did not mention the commonly heard name of Red Eyed Cicada. Perhaps that common name is only a regional thing.",

If you are just starting to be interested in identifying the most likely critters you will encounter, I think this book will serve you well. It is an all purpose field guide. If you are seeking more detail, best buy something else. The format is the same as other Audubon field guides. The photos are generally clear and the information seems accurate. Like others in the series, it is well made, just not sufficently detailed for those needing to ID less common animals.",

Information on those pages were missing. I'm am starting to think that what is sold on this website is stuff they cannot sell in stores due to it being a defect, cheap Chinese junk, or does not sell. Buy in the store so you can see the copy before you get it.",
