He truly wants everyone to enjoy the wonders of wild mushrooms safely, and he provides all the information needed in an easily readable form. This is the book to have for safe foraging. I am truly caught up in the excitement and have found a local mycology group to go into the woods with, thanks to him. Yay!!!",

After getting a super beginner book this was my \"level up,\" and it's pretty perfect. Recommend the hardcover version though, you want this one to last for a long time.",

I joined a mushroom hunting and identification club, because there are many poisonous mushrooms that look similar to edible ones. Get on the internet and look up any mushroom clubs in your area.
